# Linear calendar clock
These files are for version 1 of the clock

In this project I use adressable RGB leds and an ESP8266 to make a linear clock. The clock will also be connected to Google Calendar to show my appointments. Details on the build of the clock can be found [here](https://maakbaas.com/linear-calendar-clock/).
